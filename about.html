                    <h2>How It Started</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was searching for a way to fulfill the requirements for my capstone project
                        of my B.A. in Visual Communication Design. After searching for a project, I 
                        realized I wanted to not only fulfill requirements, but to actually make a 
                        difference with my project. Growing up I was surrounded by people on the ability
                        spectrum, without even realizing it. Getting into the field of web design, I 
                        realized that many people don't access the web in the same way that I do, and 
                        that they ended up being excluded from some experiences on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Researching more into web accessibility, the more I realized that while there were many resources
                        available, it was hard to piece them all together. I decided to solve this issue 
                        by creating this site as a resource to compile all the standards, tutorials, tools, 
                        examples, and motivations behind accessibility into one place. In this way, I hope to make 
                        accessibility more accessible, hence the name <strong>Accessible A11Y</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also hope this site can serve to dispell the myths that accessibility cannot look 
                        good, that someone's audience wouldnâ€™t benefit from accessibility measures, and that 
                        accessibility is too difficult to implement.
                    </p>

                <p>AccessibleA11Y is an open source project dedicated to connecting resources that promote a more accessible web.
                    It serves to bring together simpler standards, tutorials and tools to achieve them, personas to inspire inclusive design,
                    and examples of web sites that are both beautiful and accessible.
