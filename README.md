# Accessible Accessibility
The goal of this project is to provide a central hub for web accessibility resources. Tutorials, examples, and tools used to make a WCAG 2.0 AA compliant site are all welcome. Have something to contribute? Please feel free! Basic framework and beginnings of site should be ready by April 15, 2019.
