# Accessible A11Y
The goal of this project is to provide a central hub for web development accessibility resources. Tutorials, examples, and tools used to make a WCAG 2.1 AA compliant site are all welcome. Have something to contribute? Please do! Basic framework and beginnings of site should be ready by April 15, 2019. 

# Mission
The heart of this project is to build awareness, motivation, and technical skill for accessibility within the community of web development. Anne Gibson's article (Reframing Accessibility for the Web)[https://alistapart.com/article/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web "A List Apart - Reframing Accessibility for the Web] harnesses the passion behind this project better than I ever could.
